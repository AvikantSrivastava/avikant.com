I am Avikant, a software engineer with a strong focus on machine learning and backend development.

I currently work at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> as a Software Engineer within the Computer Security team, where I focus on consolidating infrastructure and maintaining critical services for our Security Operation Center (SoC), including intrusion detection, incident response, logging, and traceability.

Previosly I worked at <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>, I had the opportunity to work in the machine learning team, where I actively contributed to the development of industry's formost <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/features/plagiarism-detection/">AI Powered Plagiarism</a> and ML Platform buildout.

In addition to my professional work, Iâ€™m developing a multiplayer implementation of the popular card game UNO at <a href="https://avikant.com/uno">avikant.com/uno</a>. This project offers a great opportunity to learn Go, explore WebSockets, and deepen my understanding of concurrent programming.

Iâ€™m passionate about technology and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in science and tech. I love chatting about space, science, math, computing, music, philosophy, and more!


## Programming

Most of my programming experience comes from machine learning, data and backend projects and naturally <a href="https://www.python.org/"> Python </a> is my swiss army knife.
I belive in the philosophy of <a href="https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/">polyglot developer</a> and aiming to become one.

Currently I am learning about design patterns from these two resources <a href="https://refactoring.guru/"> refactoring guru</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I&list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc"> Christopher Okhravi's youtube channel </a>.

I enjoy reading about cutting-edge advancements in the world of Machine Learning / LLMs / and MLOps and enjoy working on ML problem statements. In general I am curious about "how things work", and it drove me closer to the field of ML. I feel really lucky to observe the disruption caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)"> Transformers </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model"> LLMs </a> right when I began my career as a programmer.

Here is a list of Tools and Frameworks that I have expertise in or hold a deep admiration for

- <b>FastAPI > Flask </b> (Love handy microframeworks to build quick prototypes)
- <b>Ruby on Rails / Django / Express / Node </b>(I consider all of these MVC frameworks equal, L to R in experience level)
- <b>PyTorch > Tensorflow / Pandas, scikit-learn and Numpy </b>(can't imagine my work without these)
- <b>LangChain and LlamaIndex </b>(the growing world of LLMs have piqued my interest)
- <b>Docker </b>(I just can't miss this on the list, hahaha!)
- <b>MLFlow / HuggingFace / SageMaker / KubeFlow </b>(I'm loving these MLops tools!, effortless and quick)
- <b>AWS: Lambda, EKS, ECS, SageMaker </b>(I have a love-hate relationship with AWS, though mostly it's love!)

## Interests and Hobbies

Passionate about rock and metal music, I've begun my guitar journey, inspired by my favorite bands. Follow along as I share my progress and experiences here ðŸ‘‡
